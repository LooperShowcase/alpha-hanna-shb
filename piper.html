    <h1>piper</h1>
    <p>Piper is an Epic Brawler who has the second lowest health of any Brawler but can deal very high damage to faraway targets. She fires a long-ranged bullet from her umbrella that deals more damage the further it travels. Her Super pops grenades at her feet before jumping away from her enemies, dealing damage to enemies upon detonation. Her first Gadget, Auto Aimer, allows her to fire a bullet from a side pistol towards the closest enemy, pushing them back and momentarily slowing them down. Her second Gadget, Homemade Recipe, makes her next bullet home in on enemies. Her first Star Power, Ambush, allows her to deal extra damage while firing from a bush. Her second Star Power, Snappy Sniping, reloads part of her ammo when she hits an enemy.</p>
