    <h1>brock</h1>
    <p>Spike is a Legendary Brawler with low health but a devastatingly high damage output. His attack is a cactus that explodes on impact and shoots spikes in all directions. His Super lobs a thorny projectile that creates a slowing and damaging patch of spikes on the ground. His first Gadget, Popping Pincushion, rapidly fires three waves of spikes in all directions around him. His second Gadget, Life Plant, spawns a cactus that provides cover for him and his teammates, and heals them in a radius once the cactus is destroyed. His Mythic Gear, Sticky Spikes, increases the slow of his Super. His first Star Power, Fertilize, allows Spike to heal himself over time when he's inside his Super's area of effect. His second Star Power, Curveball, causes the spikes shot out from his attack to curve in a circular motion. His Hypercharge, Blooming Season, increases his Super's radius.</p>
